# MISC code.

As a lot of developers, I write a lot of very small projects to try new things,
test stuff, try code from tutorials, etc. Even if some code is not interesting,
it's useful to get an history of all stuff we did.

Since I am on GitHub and share my code, I create a new GitHub directory every
time I try a new thing. For example, when I create a simple TODO app with
Angular or React, I create a new GitHub repository. And we must be honest, it's not useful...

So, I chose to gather all these small pieces of code in one GitHub repository,
each piece having its own directory.
